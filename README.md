# calibtools
Posterior probability calibration methods for machine learning algorithms in R. It provides calibration methods such as isotonic regression, knn-based methods, Bayesian Binning into Quantiles (BBQ), Ensemble of Linear Trend Estimation (ELiTe) in multiclass case. It also provides utilities for calibration performance measures and reliability diagrams. 

To install this R package, please run the following code in R
```
devtools::install_github("kenneth-lee-ch/calibtools")
